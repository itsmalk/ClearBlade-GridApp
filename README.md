ClearBlade Grid App

A live version can be found <a href=http://clearblade-grid-app.surge.sh/>here</a>

What it can do:

* Perform one-to-one updates to a ClearBlade collection (add rows, delete rows, update values)



Features:

 * Deletable rows based on selection
 * Can copy the value of a cell up or down a column (like excel)
 * Resizable columns
 
 If you'd like to test it locally, an easy way is with http-server.
 
 1. Download the project
 2. Install http-server
 `$ npm install http-server -g`
 3. From the root directory type 
 `$ http-server`
 4. Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8080
 
 Possible bug:
The live version once failed to load the collection, although I haven't been able to recreate it.
